<img align="left" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2813336/172672872-9692f678-1c05-4477-82e1-1f4f3427b0d6.png">

[SQLighter](https://sqlighter.com/app) is a database explorer born for SQLite that helps you learn SQL, design and deploy your application's database in minutes. Open your SQLite database by dragging its file on the page. All queries run locally in the browser with top speed. No need to install or update any apps on your desktop. Works on mobile devices as well.

### Tools 

The application is built using Next.js with a React frontend and node backend. Github is used as a collaborative CMS for markdown based contents. Directus is used as a backoffice platform for database stored records. The application runs easily on Vercel and/or Google Cloud Storage. All code is open sourced and ready to go as a deployable app for simple adoption by third parties. For development it's best to use Visual Studio Code. See [`/app/README.md`](/app/README.md) and [`/app/package.json`](/app/package.json) for more.  

Install all required libraries with:  
`yarn install`

Start serving the application with:  
`yarn run dev`
